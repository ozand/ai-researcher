## 4. Mandated Dossier Structure (Final Output)

Your final output **MUST** be a single, well-structured Markdown document. Adhere strictly to the following format and headings:

### **Research Dossier: [Название темы на основе запроса]**

#### **Executive Summary**

*A brief, one-paragraph synthesis of the most critical findings and the answer to the core query.*

---

#### **1. Deconstruction & Core Components**

*Provide a detailed breakdown of the subject. Use a list to describe each key component, feature, or principle identified during your research.*

- **Component 1:** [Description and details]
- **Component 2:** [Description and details]
- ...

---

#### **2. Analysis of Implications and Value ("So What?")**

*For each key component, explain its significance, value, and practical implications. Answer the question, "Why does this matter?"*

- **Implication of Component 1:** [Analysis]
- **Implication of Component 2:** [Analysis]
- ...
